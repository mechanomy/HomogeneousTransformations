# HomogeneousTransformations.jl
HomogeneousTransformations provides basic functions for creating and using homogeneous transformation matrices to perform 3D translations and rotations.
These are 4x4 matrices that allow rotation and translations of points to be performed, without the limitations of euler angles or quaternions.

## Use

## Dimensions

## Design
This package is intentionally simple, focused only on providing functions for calculating transformations and not attempting to include many functions like [Rigid Body Dynamics](https://github.com/JuliaRobotics/RigidBodyDynamics.jl).
